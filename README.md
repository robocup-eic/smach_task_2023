## Usage

### Task: GPSR with Smach State Generator

With the use of NLP multi-intent classifier, the robot is able to understand the user's command and execute the corresponding task. Steps of the task includes: listening to the user's command generated by a program by Robocup. Acknowledge the command by saying it back to the user. Executre the task. Report the result to the user.

Using preprogramed actions per intent as modules, then `ssc_generator.py` takes in the multi-intent split them, and generate a smach state machine. the generated ssm is saved as `temp_generated_smach_state.py`. The state machine is then is executed by immediately by the generator as a seperate thread.

To start run
```shell
# fixed parameter, great for testing
python task_gpsr_manual.py

# using NLP to extract multi-intent
python task_gpsr_auto_gen.py
```
